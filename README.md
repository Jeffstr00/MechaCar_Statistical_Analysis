# MechaCar: Statistics and R

## Overview

Jeremy is the new head of data analytics for AutosRUs, a car production company.  When the company's newest prototype, MechaCar, runs into production issues, management turns to Jeremy (who in turn asked us to help him) to see if he can use analytics to assist in looking into the issue.  Assuming they can resolve those problems, they also ask for a statistical study to be designed that can compare vehicle performance of MechaCar to that of the competition.

## Results
